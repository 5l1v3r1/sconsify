Sconsify 0.5.0, a minor release just to get some things out:

- Add a `pause` command (different than the current `play_pause` that toggles play/pause). Useful in cases such as locking the computer and pausing the music. For instance `i3` binding:

```
bindsym Control+Mod1+l exec "i3lock -c 000000 && sconsify -command pause"
```

- Ignore tracks with no artists. TODO still need fixing, maybe just ignoring the artist but still showing in the playlist.

- Spotify has changed search endpoint, it requires authentication now. Unfortunately, that means after 1 hour the token expires and search won't work anymore. As there is no way to refresh token, a sconsify restart is required.
