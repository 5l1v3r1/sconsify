Sconsify 0.4.0:

- Mark playing song in the track list.

- Search aliases `al` = `album`, `ar` = `artist`, `tr` = `track`:

```
    al:help
    ar:the beatles
    tr:let it be
```
- Fix pause to actually pause the track and not to stop it.

- Temporary playlist. Type `c` in the queue view, type a name and then a temporary playlist will appear containing all songs in the queue view.

- Show tracks as `title + artist` instead of `artist + title`.

- Load playlists using spotify web api by default as it seems that loading playlists using libspotify doesn't work anymore.

- Fix `macOS` Sierra issues by updating go (1.7.5) and fixing gco pointer rules.
