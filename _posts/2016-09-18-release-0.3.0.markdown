Sconsify 0.3.0:

* Remove track from playlist: `dd` (it doesn't save the change to spotify playlist).

* Remove playlist from playlists view: `dd`  (it doesn't save the change to spotify playlist).

* Remove all tracks from playlist: `D` (it doesn't save the change to spotify playlist).

* Preferred bitrate `-preferred-bitrate=96k, 160k, 320k`.

* Search function using spotify web-api instead of libspotify sdk. 

* `Press to load` option in the search to load more results.

* Search fields: `album, artist or track`. Examples:

```
    album:help
    artist:the beatles
    track:let it be
```

* Interprocess commands using `sconsify -command <command>`. Available commands: `replay, play_pause, next`. For instance my [i3](http://i3wm.org/) config file has this configuration so I can use keyboard buttons to replay, play/pause and go to the next track:

```
    bindsym XF86AudioPrev exec sconsify -command replay
    bindsym XF86AudioPlay exec sconsify -command play_pause
    bindsym XF86AudioNext exec sconsify -command next
```

* Experimental use of spotify web-api to have access to saved albums, saved songs and new releases. It needs a web autentication to get an access token valid for 1 hour. After 1 hour it won't be able to access the web-api anymore and there's no way to refresh the token, only quiting and opening the application again. Pass `-web-api` flag to use it.
